I started supplying mustard husk as biomass, and then gradually also provided shredded juliflora as a biomass – employing 15 people for 8months of the year along the way. </p>

              <p>I’m planting other high value crops like cumin and fenugreek, have adopted micro-irrigation and am exploring stronger markets for my produce with other farmers. This is how we have managed to pull down our mud hut, build a pucca house, purchase a bike and invest in a tractor. Today, I no longer work as a labourer, but hire labour on my 3-acre farm.</p>
